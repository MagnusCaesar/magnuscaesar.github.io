# Magnus Caesar's Website
This is a website   
I finally have one for myself, thank you github   

Hello there! now that all the gratitude is over, welcome to my website.

I've no clue why I've one right now, but I plan on making this like a CV type thing, of course sticking to my anonymity and all that, mostly for my tiny progs and other study-type contribs

Well now that you've seen this, enjoy and make your own too   
make sure to keep it public if you don't want to pay
